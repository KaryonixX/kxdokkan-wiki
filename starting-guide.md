## **Getting Started**

**DISCLAIMER: To get KX-Dokkan please join the Discord and follow the instructions!**
[Discord here](https://discord.gg/kxdokkan)

### iOS/iPadOS

 The first step for Android is to download the IPA for [**KX-Plus**](https://discord.com/channels/794907952766255154/1008103015867228160)
 or [**KX-Vanilla**](https://discord.com/channels/794907952766255154/1136642538606956544) onto your device.

You can either use Sideloadly, AltStore or other third party signing services.
For KX we prefer the first 2 methods:
 - [**Sideloadly**](https://sideloadly.io/) **More robust/reliable way of sideloading**
 - [**AltStore**](https://altstore.io/) **Easier on-device reprovisioning**

 ### Android

 The first step for Android is to download the APK for [**KX-Plus**](https://discord.com/channels/794907952766255154/1008103015867228160)
 or [**KX-Vanilla**](https://discord.com/channels/794907952766255154/1136642538606956544).

 Make sure, as with all other APKs that you have installations from external sources allowed on Android.

### Getting your linkcode

Head to [**#general-plus**](https://discord.com/channels/794907952766255154/1102928322733822062) for KX-Plus users
or to [**general**](https://discord.com/channels/794907952766255154/1140767565614956634) for KX-Vanilla users and do /register to get your linkcode!

**You'll be able to see that you can use /register for either Vanilla or Plus in the aforementioned channels.**

If you already got your code before, use **/linkcode** to renew your code and invalidate all older ones.

### Setting up the Game

Open the installed KX-Plus or KX-Vanilla App and you should press the **Red Button/"Continue Game"** when prompted.


![**redbutton](/imgs/redbutton.png)
then you'll continue with the Transfer code method, its the only field you can press.
![**transfer-code](/imgs/transfer-code.png)

After that we make sure to transfer the code over we got from the /register or /linkcode command.

Press **OK** and you should see that the game asks you to load a RANK 999 or 777 data, we continue to click through all upcoming prompts until we reach a Data-Download of approximately 13 GB in size.

**MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH STORAGE AND A STABLE CONNECTION FOR THIS DATA-DL, TURN OFF ALL VPN-CONNECTIONS!**

After the DL has finished, you should find yourself inside of the game. Enjoy!
