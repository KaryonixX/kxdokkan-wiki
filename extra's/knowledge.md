## **Custom Level**

In order to have a custom lvl like 420 all you have to do is add a new row in card_exps set lvl to desired lvl and set exp_type (to a random number above 999 or 4 trillion or a negative number) set exp_total to any number below 0 go to cards and set   exp_type to the number you set it to in card_exps table and set training_exp to the number you set it to in card_exps.exp_total and set lvl_max to the lvl amount you set it to in card_exps

## **Copy an existing Super Attack**


Get the view Id of that super and go to **specials\_views** <br>
In there search the id with the view id, it will appear a script name <br>
Now In the assets search the folder named Lua then inside that folder go to ab_script then attack\_sp <br>
Inside that folder search the script name and save the script (we'll need it for later)<br>
Now what you want to do is search the effects of the super in **effect\_packs** <br>

We'll need two things now : <br>
1)The id's from the scenes (to help with this just search the sp\_effect and the just search all rows with this sp\_effect)<br>
2)The assets of the super

Create a new sp\_effect folder that can be called anything and paste all the assets there (change the lwf name to the same as the folder)
Create the same amount of rows in the **effect\_packs** as the original and copy all things except the pack name and the id

In the pack name we'll put the name of our folder and in id it can be whatever that isn't used

Now we'll open the script from earlier (can be opened with notepad) and search the original IDs from effect\_packs and replace it with the new ones just created <br>
Change the name of the script to whatever you like and save

Now we just head up to the database and in special\_views we'll create a new row with any Id and in the script name we just put the name of the script we copied

And done! The Id in the row of **special\_views** will be used as a view id in the original super

## **Leader Skills**

#### **Sub Target Types**

To create custom leader skills of category + category first you will need to go `sub_target_type_sets` and create 2 rows there, give them any id you want, then go to `sub_target_types` and create 3 rows with the first 2 having the **same sub\_target\_set\_id as one of the first row created earlier** one of those will have as **target\_ value\_type** 1 and **target\_value** will be the category id of the primary leader skill, the othe will have **target\_value\_type** 2 and the **target\_value** will be the category id of the secondary part of the leader skill , now, for the third row as the sub target set id you will set the id of the **second row you created earlier** and use **target\_value \_type** 1 and for the **target\_value** it will be once again the category id of the secondary part of the leader skill.

Now go back to your leader skill and set the sub target types set id's 1 and 2 as the first row you created in `sub_target_type_sets` and for the 3rd and 4th set id set it as the second row previously created in `sub_target_type_sets`.


#### **Leader Skill Efficacy**

**efficacy_type1** = 104

**efficacy_type2** = 5

**efficacy_type3** = 104

**efficacy_type4** = 5

**target_type** = 2

------------------------
* 
*eff1 corresponds to the first category you chose*

eff1_value1 = HP

eff1_value2 = ATK

eff1_value3 = DEF

------------------------
* 
*eff2 corresponds to the ki amount of the first category you chose*

eff2_value1 = Ki

eff2_value2 = 0

eff2_value3 = 0

------------------------
* 
*eff3 corresponds to the second category you chose*

eff3_value1 = HP

eff3_value2 = ATK

eff3_value3 = DEF

------------------------
* 
*eff4 corresponds to the ki amount of the second category you chose*

eff4_value1 = Ki

eff4_value2 = 0

eff4_value3 = 0

## **How to link an animation to a transformation**

How to link an animation to a transformation
If you already have the lwf and the images then it's easy
First you need to create a new folder in ingame/battle/effect/"New folder"
Its preferable to call it something like "Battle_00000"
00000 being any id you want
In that folder you will put the inages and the lwf
Now to link it go to effect_packs
Then create a row in effect_packs with any id and make the category 1
The name doesn't matter
And the pack name will be the same as the folder you created
And scene name will be ef_001
All the other things like blue red and those will be 255
Now in the battle params of the transformation link the idx 1 value with the effect pack id
And that's it
