         Read more about it [here.](https://discord.com/channels/794907952766255154/809527253988802600)

 - Q: Where is the Bot?
    - A: Chroma *(previously KX-Chroma)* is still under development and will make a comeback as a seperate Program on a new Server!
    
 - Q: Will we have patches soon?
    - A: Yes, a Patcher is currently in the works and KX-Dokkan will soon be enjoyable with a patcher system where you can toggle the mods you want.

 - Q: Does KX advance my own account?
    - A: No! KX-Dokkan is completely independant from the original game servers and does not put your account in any sort of ban risk or modify it in any way.

 - Q: A new character released on Dokkan! How do i get it?
    - A: On KX-Vanilla the DDLs are automatic, which means as soon as dokkan releases this character via Data-DL it should be visible in KX-Vanilla 10-20m afterwards.
         However we cannot add a new character based on just a new trailer or leaks. On KX-Plus new DLs are added shortly afterwards (could be directly after or 1-2 days depending on what type of content has released.)

 - Q: Can i add my own ideas and characters?
    - A: We're currently working on a new Tutorial for everyone with KX-Plus to be able to realize their ideas into the game! More info will be here when its done.
