#### **I can't install the new patcher or game APK.**
Check to make sure you have enough room on your phone;<br /><br />

#### **Does this work on iOS?**
No. I do not have any Apple devices to develop with, and I do not know anyone capable of taking over the iOS side of UniDokkan development.<br /><br />

#### **Do I have to run the patcher app each time I want to play the game with patches?**
Yes. The patcher does not modify any game files permanently. You must start the game through the patcher to have it use the patched files.<br /><br />

#### **The game crashes when I launch it through the patcher.**
Make sure you've let the game do a full data download before running it through the patcher.<br /><br />

#### **I can't buy stones**
Any modifications to the game remove the ability to make in-app purchases due Android security measures and policies. If you wish to buy stones, transfer back to the original DOKKAN BATTLE game.<br /><br />

#### **What happens when DOKKAN BATTLE updates?**
For full game updates where the version number changes an update will be posted. Do not uninstall the previous version. The newer version will update any previous installation. Individual patch updates are the responsibility of their creators and can have varying update time-frames.<br /><br />

#### **Does UniDokkan do anything to the gameâ€™s servers?**
No. It can only apply client sided changes.<br /><br />

#### **I'm having trouble linking with Facebook**
Uninstall the Facebook App, it can cause issue with linking.<br /><br />
