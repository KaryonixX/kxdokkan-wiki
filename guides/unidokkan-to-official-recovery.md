**1. Backup your account.**

Your account information can be found in a hidden folder named `.com.unidokkan.dbzdokkan`.

This folder will be found differently depending on your phone. Usually its under `/sdcard` or `/storage/emulated/0/`. It will be in the same folder with `DCIM` and `Download` folders.

Some Android file explorers have these folders hidden. There will usually be an option in their settings to show hidden folders. If not, you can always try installing a different file explorer.

Once you find that folder, it will contain two files: `device` and `identifier`. Back these files up to a safe place like Google Drive or Dropbox. These are basically your username and password and will be valid until you do a transfer.

**2. Copy your account.**

Go back to the `.com.unidokkan.dbzdokkan` folder. 

You're going to want to make a copy of this folder. 

The new copy should be named `.com.bandainamcogames.dbzdokkan` (make sure you don't forget the beginning dot) .

If you already have a folder by that name, back that folder up to Google Drive or Dropbox and then delete it.

This step is done when you have a copy of the `.com.unidokkan.dbzdokkan` folder named `.com.bandainamcogames.dbzdokkan`

**3. Install and Account Recover**

If you renamed your account folder to `.com.bandainamcogames.dbzdokkan`, install the official client from [QooApp](https://apps.qoo-app.com/en/app/191)

After installation, you can launch the game. Eventually you will see the following screen. **Press the right button**; this will recover your account using the new folder you made.
