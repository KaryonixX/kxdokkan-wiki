Title: Getting Started with UniDokkan
Sort: 1
---
This guide is for new or returning users of the UniDokkan patching system for Dokkan Battle.

**IMPORTANT:** As you go through this guide and use UniDokkan you must agree to the following things:

 1. **UniDokkan is currently in beta!** This means that features will change or things can break at any time.
 2. **Keep your Dokkan Battle account safe!** The best thing you can do is keep your account linked to Facebook. An unlinked account is the best way to lose the account forever. Don't gamble with account recovery denying your account.
 3. **You are the only one responsible for your Dokkan Battle account!** Do not use UniDokkan (or any other mod) if you refuse to accept the risk of being banned by breaking Dokkan Battle's Terms of Service. I go through great effort to make sure the patching system remains undetected, but nothing is perfect.

## **What is UniDokkan?**

UniDokkan is an Android patching system for Dokkan Battle. It allows you to enable and disable modifications to the game simply and safely without the need for a rooted device.

We also have a great open community where all kinds of technical information is shared to learn about about Dokkan. It's my personal goal that people in the UniDokkan community can learn new things to be used elsewhere in their future. 

Finally, there is the UniDokkan website where I personally host Dokkan tools, like a fully in-browser Dokkan animation player, and a Wiki where I try and keep all our information for UniDokkan and Dokkan in one place.

## **Getting Started**

**First,** you must download the following to your Android device:

 1. **UniDokkan Dokkan APK (UD):**
	 - [Download Global](https://unidokkan.com/api/sl/apk/glb)
 2. **UniDokkan Patcher:** 
	 - [Download Patcher](https://unidokkan.com/api/sl/patcher)

You do not need to uninstall any other Dokkan Battle versions. If you have the space on your device, I recommend that you keep any other version you have.


**Emulator Warning:**
*Your emulator must be using Android version 5. Please follow your emulator's instructions. We do not officially support emulators but have seen success with **Nox** and **Memu**.*
